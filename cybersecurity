Two things that comes to my mind when I hear the word Cybersecurity is'REAL TIME PROBLEM-SOLVERS'and 'SUPERHEROES'.
  Hi there, I'm Ucheagwu Chinyere-a recent graduate of English Language and Literature. A content writer who is currently trying to build a career in Cybersecurity at Altschool Africa.
  I decided to take this path because my friend and I have been victims of cyber attack. It happened when our Whatsapp account was hacked. Suddenly lost access to our accounts.
I was devastated because apart as a small entrepreneur, it affected my business a great deal. I lost tracks of my customer orders, their contacts, my personal details as well as my account details were compromised to the extent te attackers tried to dupe people by impersonating me.
  One day, I was scrolling on X when I stumbled upon a young girl who tweeted about how she was able to retrieve her friend's account. I got interested. In fact, that was the validation I needed to explore the field of Cybersecurity. I was in awe thinking that Cybersecurity was all this and much more, I had a burning desire to contribute my quota to organizations and society at large.
  Then, I made a promise to build and pursue a career in Cybersecurity because I would love to protect people and systems from cyber threats.
  My goals are to build and gain a wealth of knowledge and experience by;
-Being open to learning
-Volunteering
  -Interning with organizations
-Committing myself to a life-long learning.
And this coming new year, I want to help as many people as I can by teaching them how to easily protect themselves against cyber attacks. Of course, I plan to do it in a less techy way by breaking down big concepts.
  I'm eager to connect with Cybersecurity professionals. I would reallylove to learn from your experiences. 
  Cheers to the noble action of protecting people, systems and networks. 
  P.S. Merry Christmas and Happy new year!
